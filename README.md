# arm-templator
Generate ARM templates programmatically by writing Typescript.

## Running tests
Tests can be executed by running `npm test`. The tests simply execute a named `input.ts` file in subdirectories of the [tests](./tests/) directory, and compare the generated output to the `output.json` template file.

## Examples
See [https://github.com/anthony-c-martin/arm-templator-usage](arm-templator-usage) for some examples.
